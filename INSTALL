To compile the VRPH library, and the four binaries,
vrp_rtr, vrp_sa, vrp_ej, and vrp_init, you should just
be able to run "make" from this directory (VRPH-1.0/).

There are no external dependencies to build these applications
and I have encountered no difficulties after trying
various Linux and Cygwin installations.

The VRPH-1.0/MSVC_2008 directory contains a VRPH.sln file that
contains projects for building the VRPH library and these
four applications.  Again, these are all self-contained
and the solution should build with no warnings or errors.

When you run "make" or build the Visual Studio solution,
the VRPH-1.0 library (libvrph.a or vrph.lib) is created in 
the VRPH-1.0/lib/ directory.  The four applications are then
created in the VRPH-1.0/bin directory by statically linking 
to this library.

To build the vrp_sp application, you will
need a working installation of Coin-OSI, CoinUtils, and
the GLPK MIP solver.  Assuming this is the case, you then
need to modify the directories in the makefile so that the
compiler can find the relevant include and lib directories.

To build the vrp_plotter application, you will need a working
installation of the PLPlot library.  Then modify the directories
in the makefile so that the compiler can find the include
files and the PLPlot library.
