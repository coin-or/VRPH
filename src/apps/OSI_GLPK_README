Building GLPK is straightforward with the usual ./configure and make procedure.
To build the necessary OSI components, here is what to do. Download the latest
copy of the OSI from the Coin-OR website (or grab it from the svn repository).

Then cd to the root directory of the OSI tree and make a directory for your build:

mkdir x86_64_build
cd x86_64_build 
 
You don't need all of the OSI functionality, and I used static libraries with GLPK as follows: 
 
../configure --with-glpk-lib="-L$HOME/GLPK/lib -lglpk" --with-glpk-incdir="$HOME/GLPK/include" COIN_SKIP_PROJECTS="DyLP Vol Cbc Cgl" --enable-static --disable-shared -C
make
make test
make install

After doing this, I have directories x86_64/lib and x86_64/include/coin that have the required
include and library files necessary for the OSI functionality used in this example.
It should be straightforward to use something other than GLPK and then adapt the above
procedure in the obvious way with minimal modification to the OSI parts of the VRPH source code.
