There are 6 project files here in the appropriate directories.  The
VRPH project builds the static library and the other projects are
linked statically to this library.  To build the vrp_plot application,
you need to first build the VRPH library with HAS_PLPLOT defined and 
add the include the directory for the PLPlot header files.  Then
add the PLPlot include and library directories to the vrp_plot 
project.  This project is not included in the VRPH solution file
so that all the projects in the solution can be built initially 
without modification.

The library and executable files are built in the VRPH\MSVC_2008\VRPH\Debug 
or VRPH\MSVC_2008\VRPH\Release directory depending on the configuration 
(Debug or Release).

I did succeed in compiling the vrp_sp application on Windows but it
requires a number of GLPK and OSI external dependencies and so I did 
not include it in this distribution.
